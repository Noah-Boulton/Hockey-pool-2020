  <div class="Rules">
      <h1>The Rules</h1>
      <p>The rules are very simple and everyone is encouraged to play (even if you know nothing about hockey). Signing up is entirely free and if you end up winning you will receive $20 as well as the “Top Ho Cup”!</p>
      <p>As long as you follow these rules you have a chance to be crowned Mo’s Top Ho!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mo’s Hockey Ho’s operates on a Player Point Value system. This means that each player has a “point value” that is associated with them. Your team cannot exceed a total Point Value of 25. You can look at all of the Player’s Values here.</li>
        <li>An approved team consists of 5 forwards, 3 defensemen and 2 goalies. Again to reiterate your total team value must NOT EXCEED 25 points.</li>
        <li>Each player can only be picked once for your team. What I mean is I don’t want to see any hosers picking Sidney Crosby for every forward slot.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring: </strong>Each Skater will have 1 point awarded for Goals and 1 for Assists. Each Goalie will have 2 points awarded for Wins and 1 additional point for a Shutout. (Goalies also will be awarded points for Goals and Assists if necessary)</li>
        <li><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> Picking a team is very CRUCIAL. It is the only thing that you will have control of in this league. Once your team is picked and approved you will not be able to make any trades or changes throughout the ENTIRE PLAYOFFS. This means that if a team that a player you have chosen is on becomes eliminated that player will obviously no longer be in the tournament and will therefore no longer be able to acquire points for your team. This also means that if a player you have chosen becomes injured then tough luck for both of you (but mostly you).</li>
        <li>Submissions are now closed. Tie breakers will look at the following:
          <ol type='A'>
            <li>Most active players on team in the end</li>
            <li>Most goals scored by team in total</li> 
            <li>Team whose player has the highest point total between those tied</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>MAY THE TOP HO WIN!</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
